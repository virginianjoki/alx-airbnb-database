## üß™ Performance Testing with `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`

### ‚úÖ Example Query

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM bookings WHERE user_id = 10;
--before index--
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM bookings WHERE user_id = 10;
--output--
Seq Scan on bookings  (cost=0.00..1000.00 rows=5000 width=8)
Execution Time: 12.745 ms
--after axecution--
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM bookings WHERE user_id = 10;
-- output--
Index Scan using idx_bookings_user_id on bookings  (cost=0.29..8.37 rows=500 width=8)
Execution Time: 1.002 ms
